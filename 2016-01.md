  - For eg. when Israeli prisoners appeared for parole hearing, those that appeared earlier in the day had higher chances of parole instead of those that appeared later in the day when the judges were tired.
  - The more choices you make throughout the day, the harder each one becomes for your brain, and eventually it looks for shortcuts, usually in either of two very different ways. **One shortcut is to become reckless**: to act impulsively instead of expending the energy to first think through the consequences. (Sure, tweet that photo! What could go wrong?) **The other shortcut is the ultimate energy saver: do nothing**. Instead of agonizing over decisions, avoid any choice. Ducking a decision often creates bigger problems in the long run, but for the moment, it eases the mental strain.  
  - Experiments demonstrated that there is a **finite store of mental energy for exerting self-control**. Willpower really was a form of mental energy that could be exhausted. 
  - Its even more draining to figure out for ourselves what we want and to go through the process of choosing instead of simply pondering throught the options only or to implement other's choices
  - Part of the resistance against making decisions comes from our **fear of giving up options**. The word “decide” shares an etymological root with “homicide,” the Latin word “caedere,” meaning “to cut down” or “to kill,” and that loss looms especially large when decision fatigue sets in. 
  - **Once you’re mentally depleted, you become reluctant to make trade-offs**, which involve a particularly advanced and taxing form of decision making. In the rest of the animal kingdom, there aren’t a lot of protracted negotiations between predators and prey. To compromise is a complex human ability and therefore one of the first to decline when willpower is depleted. You become what researchers call a cognitive miser, hoarding your energy. If you’re shopping, you’re liable to look at only one dimension, like price: just give me the cheapest. Or you indulge yourself by looking at quality: I want the very best (an especially easy strategy if someone else is paying). **Decision fatigue leaves you vulnerable to marketers who know how to time their sales**, as Jonathan Levav, the Stanford professor, demonstrated in experiments involving tailored suits and new cars. 
  - Shopping can be especially tiring for the poor, who have to struggle continually with trade-offs. In the slightly more affluent villages, people’s willpower wasn’t affected significantly. Because they had more money, they didn’t have to spend as much effort weighing the merits of the soap versus, say, food or medicine. 
  - Researchers argue that this sort of decision fatigue is a major — and hitherto ignored — **factor in trapping people in poverty**. Because their financial situation forces them to make so many trade-offs, they have less willpower to devote to school, work and other activities that might get them into the middle class. Study after study has shown that **low self-control correlates with low income** as well as with a host of other problems, including poor achievement in school, divorce, crime, alcoholism and poor health.  
  - By the time shoppers reach the cash register, they’ll have less willpower left to resist the Mars bars and Skittles. Not for nothing are these items called impulse purchases. And this isn’t the only **reason that sweet snacks are featured prominently at the cash register**, just when shoppers are depleted after all their decisions in the aisles. With their willpower reduced, they’re more likely to yield to any kind of temptation, but they’re especially vulnerable to candy and soda and anything else offering a **quick hit of sugar**. While supermarkets figured this out a long time ago, only recently did researchers discover why.
  - The glucose in cold drinks or dairy products at least mitigate the ego depletion and sometimes completely reverse it. The **restored willpower** improved people’s self-control as well as the quality of their decisions: they resisted irrational bias when making choices, and when asked to make financial decisions, they were more likely to choose the better long-term strategy instead of going for a quick payoff.  
  - The discoveries about glucose help explain why dieting is a uniquely difficult test of self-control — and why even people with phenomenally strong willpower in the rest of their lives can have such a hard time losing weight. They start out the day with virtuous intentions, resisting croissants at breakfast and dessert at lunch, but each act of resistance further lowers their willpower. They’re trapped in a nutritional catch-22:
    - In order not to eat, a dieter needs willpower.
    - In order to have willpower, a dieter needs to eat.
  - A sugar-filled snack or drink will provide a quick improvement in self-control (that’s why it’s convenient to use in experiments), but it’s just a temporary solution. The problem is that what we identify as sugar doesn’t help as much over the course of the day as the steadier supply of glucose we would get from eating proteins and other more nutritious foods. 
  - When faced with a new desire that produced some I-want-to-but-I-really-shouldn’t sort of inner conflict, they gave in more readily if they had already fended off earlier temptations, particularly if the new temptation came soon after a previously reported one. 
  - We have no way of knowing how much our ancestors exercised self-control in the days before BlackBerrys and social psychologists, but it seems likely that many of them were under less ego-depleting strain. When there were fewer decisions, there was less decision fatigue. Today we feel overwhelmed because there are so many choices. Your body may have dutifully reported to work on time, but your mind can escape at any instant. 
  - A typical computer user looks at more than three dozen Web sites a day and gets fatigued by the continual decision making — whether to keep working on a project, check out TMZ, follow a link to YouTube or buy something on Amazon. You can do enough damage in a 10-minute online shopping spree to wreck your budget for the rest of the year. 
  - When the brain’s regulatory powers weaken, frustrations seem more irritating than usual. Impulses to eat, drink, spend and say stupid things feel more powerful (and alcohol causes self-control to decline further). Like those dogs in the experiment, ego-depleted humans become more likely to get into needless fights over turf. In making decisions, they take illogical shortcuts and tend to favor short-term gains and delayed costs.  
  - **“Good decision making is not a trait of the person, in the sense that it’s always there, It’s a state that fluctuates.”** 
  - **People with the best self-control are the ones who structure their lives so as to conserve willpower**. They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it’s available for emergencies and important decisions. 
  - **“Even the wisest people won’t make good choices when they’re not rested and their glucose is low,”** Baumeister points out. That’s why the truly wise don’t restructure the company at 4 p.m. They don’t make major commitments during the cocktail hour. And if a decision must be made late in the day, they know not to do it on an empty stomach. “The best decision makers,” Baumeister says, “are the ones who know when not to trust themselves.” 

- [Sugar isn’t just making us fat, it’s making us sick](http://qz.com/535957/sugar-isnt-just-making-us-fat-its-making-us-sick/)
  - Based on a research at University of California, SF
  - Children are manifesting increased rates of adult diseases like hypertension or high triglycerides, and getting diseases that use to be unhdeard of in children like Type 2 disbetes and fatty liver disease
  - Obesity is increasing globally at 1% per year, while diabetes is increasing globally at 4% per year. If diabetes were just a subset of obesity, how can you explain its more rapid increase
  - And certain countries are obese without being diabetic (such as Iceland, Mongolia and Micronesia), while other countries are diabetic without being obese (India, Pakistan and China, for instance). Twelve percent of people in China have diabetes, but the obesity rate is much lower. The US is the fattest nation on Earth and our diabetes prevalence is 9.3%. 
  - We now know that obesity is a marker rather than a cause for these diseases. 
  - Sugar by itself furnishes energy, and that’s about it. In that sense, **sugar is like alcohol**. It’s got calories, but it’s not nutrition. There’s no biochemical reaction that requires it. And at high doses, alcohol can fry your liver. 
  - Same with sugar. Fructose, the sweet molecule in sugar, contains calories that you can burn for energy, but it’s not nutrition, because there’s no biochemical reaction that requires it. In excess, it can fry your liver, just like alcohol. And this makes sense, because where do you get alcohol from? Fermentation of sugar. 

- [Mindfulness is for mere mortals…](http://patrickrhone.com/2015/12/30/mindfulness-is-for-mere-mortals/)
  - The truth is that we spend most of our lives missing out on most of what is going on around us. We have limited capacity and our minds prioritize our focus according to our needs and desires. Needs and desires come from a dissatisfaction with the present. The want of something else, something more, something that does not yet exist. 
  - The truth is that even just taking a few moments to stop, be present, and observe as fully as possible the world around you counts just as much as meditation as any full on two week zen retreat. And you, mere mortal, can do that. A five-year-old can.
  - Because meditation helps you see the world, and your self in it, for what it is — not what you wish it to be. Meditation will help you learn to focus your energy on the things you can change — right here and now — and ignore the things you can’t (especially that which is not right here and now). When your energy is then focused on direct action on changing that which causes you suffering, discomfort, and stress, you will change it. You will learn to simply let go of those feelings for the things you can’t change.

- [Here’s Why Public Wifi is a Public Health Hazard](https://medium.com/matter/heres-why-public-wifi-is-a-public-health-hazard-dd5b8dcb55e6#.vmw3z2m5y)
  - We are able to see which wifi networks the devices were previously connected to, even track past locations visited
  - Most smartphones, laptops and tablets automatically search and connect to network with a previously established connection. The device is capable to registering these searches and appearing as that trusted wifi network.
  - Able to see the specs of connected devices like models, language settings, os versions and exploit for security bugs
