  - Based on a research at University of California, SF
  - Children are manifesting increased rates of adult diseases like hypertension or high triglycerides, and getting diseases that use to be unhdeard of in children like Type 2 disbetes and fatty liver disease
  - Obesity is increasing globally at 1% per year, while diabetes is increasing globally at 4% per year. If diabetes were just a subset of obesity, how can you explain its more rapid increase
  - And certain countries are obese without being diabetic (such as Iceland, Mongolia and Micronesia), while other countries are diabetic without being obese (India, Pakistan and China, for instance). Twelve percent of people in China have diabetes, but the obesity rate is much lower. The US is the fattest nation on Earth and our diabetes prevalence is 9.3%. 
  - We now know that obesity is a marker rather than a cause for these diseases. 
  - Sugar by itself furnishes energy, and that’s about it. In that sense, **sugar is like alcohol**. It’s got calories, but it’s not nutrition. There’s no biochemical reaction that requires it. And at high doses, alcohol can fry your liver. 
  - Same with sugar. Fructose, the sweet molecule in sugar, contains calories that you can burn for energy, but it’s not nutrition, because there’s no biochemical reaction that requires it. In excess, it can fry your liver, just like alcohol. And this makes sense, because where do you get alcohol from? Fermentation of sugar. 

- [Mindfulness is for mere mortals…](http://patrickrhone.com/2015/12/30/mindfulness-is-for-mere-mortals/)
  - The truth is that we spend most of our lives missing out on most of what is going on around us. We have limited capacity and our minds prioritize our focus according to our needs and desires. Needs and desires come from a dissatisfaction with the present. The want of something else, something more, something that does not yet exist. 
  - The truth is that even just taking a few moments to stop, be present, and observe as fully as possible the world around you counts just as much as meditation as any full on two week zen retreat. And you, mere mortal, can do that. A five-year-old can.
  - Because meditation helps you see the world, and your self in it, for what it is — not what you wish it to be. Meditation will help you learn to focus your energy on the things you can change — right here and now — and ignore the things you can’t (especially that which is not right here and now). When your energy is then focused on direct action on changing that which causes you suffering, discomfort, and stress, you will change it. You will learn to simply let go of those feelings for the things you can’t change.

- [Here’s Why Public Wifi is a Public Health Hazard](https://medium.com/matter/heres-why-public-wifi-is-a-public-health-hazard-dd5b8dcb55e6#.vmw3z2m5y)
  - We are able to see which wifi networks the devices were previously connected to, even track past locations visited
  - Most smartphones, laptops and tablets automatically search and connect to network with a previously established connection. The device is capable to registering these searches and appearing as that trusted wifi network.
  - Able to see the specs of connected devices like models, language settings, os versions and exploit for security bugs
