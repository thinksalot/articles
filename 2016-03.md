###[Facebook is eating the world](http://www.cjr.org/analysis/facebook_and_media.php)
- News publishers have lost control over news distribution. News is now filtered through algorithms and platforms that are opaque and unpredictable
- Power of social media companies is increasing interms of who publishes what to whom and how the content is monitized.
- Mobile revolution is largely behind this changing landscape. We spend tremendous amount of time online using out mobile phones.
- Majority of uses get their new using facebook.
- Publishers are losing control over ads. The distributing platform controls the showing on ads and in some cases can be blocked (like in iOS). So they have 3 options:
  - Push content straight to apps like Facebook where ads cant be blocked or is harder to do
  - Build other businesses and revenues away from distributed platforms.
  - Make advertising that doesnt look like advertising at all eg. viral videos
- Media companies are seeing maybe 3-4x traffic when going through distribution platforms. It has become tempting to abandon all technical and advertising capacities and totally relay on platforms but this could be a high risk strategy (as you lose relationship with your visitors and lose control over advertising).
- We need regulation to make sure that all public speech and expression will be treated transparently.
- What once looked like the full democratization of the open web is now looking like being controlled by few companies that didn't start out to take responsibilities of the free press in the first place.
