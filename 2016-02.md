###[How to Read a Book a Week](https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week)
- You dont need to read the whole book, you just need to understand them
- Fiction demands that we enter a world made by the author for a more inspiring and immersive experience. Non-fiction on the other hand, makes a point and asks us to learn from it.
- Start with the author - find out the person's bias and perspective
- Find the big-picture of the argument of the book by reading the title, subtitle, the front flap and table of contents
- The author makes the case in the opening and closing argument of the book. So read the intro and conclusion.
- Read or skim each chapter to find out how the author is using the chapter and where it fits into the argument of the book. Read the first and last sentence of each paragraph and move on if you get the meaning. Otherwise, read the whole paragraph to understand better.
- Review the table of contents again to make sure you've understood the entire argument of the book. Try to summarize each chapter in your head

###[Imagining your future projects is holding you back.](http://jessicaabel.com/2016/01/27/idea-debt/)
- Idea debt is when you spend too much time picturing what a project is going to be like, too much time thinking about how awesome it will be to have this thing done. But you spend way too little time actually making the thing. You have no actionable plan to realize your ideas.
- Get rid of some of the ideas that you've been carrying around for years and you'll recover massive amounts of psychic energy. This energy is what you will focus on the one thing you actually do want to be doing right now.
