###[Why use www?](http://www.yes-www.org/why-use-www/)
- Using www helps you to redirect traffic from a failing server to healthy server. This is effectively done using DNS CNAME records which is only possible if you have www in your domain
- The cookies set using a naked domain gets sent to all subdomains which slows down access to static content and might cause caching to not work properly
- Cookies set by naked domains might not work across all subdomains
- Best to redirect no-www to www
