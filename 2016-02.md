###[Mobile, smartphones and hindsight](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/2/19/mobile-smartphones-and-hindsight)
- The arrival of iphone dates the mobile history to an 'before' and 'after' period. Before the iphone, it didnt feel like people were deperately looking for some catalytic event. People in 'middle ages' were living in the 'middle ages' without knowing.
- Back in 2001, although ipod looked like an expensive toy, it was signalling a fundamental change in phones. Things that look like expensive toys are often the future.
- When iphone was first released, the senior management in Nokia and RIM laughed at it, seeing only the minimal parts of the MVP and not realising the fundamental shift. By the time they realised they made a major strategic problem, it was already too late.
- When 3g first showed up, everybody was asking 'whats the killer app for 3G?'. It turned out that the killer app for having the internet in your pocket was, well, having the internet in your pocket, but that was the wrong question.

###[How to Read a Book a Week](https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week)
- You dont need to read the whole book, you just need to understand them
- Fiction demands that we enter a world made by the author for a more inspiring and immersive experience. Non-fiction on the other hand, makes a point and asks us to learn from it.
- Start with the author - find out the person's bias and perspective
- Find the big-picture of the argument of the book by reading the title, subtitle, the front flap and table of contents
- The author makes the case in the opening and closing argument of the book. So read the intro and conclusion.
- Read or skim each chapter to find out how the author is using the chapter and where it fits into the argument of the book. Read the first and last sentence of each paragraph and move on if you get the meaning. Otherwise, read the whole paragraph to understand better.
- Review the table of contents again to make sure you've understood the entire argument of the book. Try to summarize each chapter in your head

###[Imagining your future projects is holding you back.](http://jessicaabel.com/2016/01/27/idea-debt/)
- Idea debt is when you spend too much time picturing what a project is going to be like, too much time thinking about how awesome it will be to have this thing done. But you spend way too little time actually making the thing. You have no actionable plan to realize your ideas.
- Get rid of some of the ideas that you've been carrying around for years and you'll recover massive amounts of psychic energy. This energy is what you will focus on the one thing you actually do want to be doing right now.
