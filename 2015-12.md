- [The Good Enough Parent is the Best Parent](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201512/the-good-enough-parent-is-the-best-parent)
  - Good enough parents do not strive to be perfect parents and do not expect perfection from their children. 
    - Every blemish, even ones you can do nothing about is magnified
    - Imperfections in human beings are unavoidable
    - Perfectionism promotes tendency to blame. Perfectionist reasoning: If problems arise, then they must be someone's fault. So parents seeking perfection blame themselves, their spouse or their children
  - Good enough parents respect their children and try to understand them for who they are. 
    - The good enough parent strives to get to know the child, so as to understand the child’s needs and wants. 
    - Children are generally not as good as adults at stating their reasons or arguing logically, so it is unfair for parents to expect their children to always give good reasons for what they do. 
  - Good enough parents are more concerned for the child’s experience of childhood than with the child’s future as an adult. 
    - It is the child, not the parent, who must determine his or her goals in life and route toward achieving them.  The parent's job is to assure that the child has a satisfying childhood. 
  - Good enough parents provide the help that their children need and want, but not more than they need or want. 
    - They allow their children the freedom to take risks and to do for themselves what they can.  Good enough parents allow their children to make mistakes and to fail, because they know that mistakes and failures are inevitable components of learning.   
  - Good enough parents are confident that their good enough parenting is good enough. 
    - Parents who feel confident about their parenting will be more calm and patient, less anxious in their parenting, and will thereby provide a greater source of security for their children, than parents who don’t feel so confident. 

- [Why It’s Great to Have a Stubborn Child](http://time.com/4130665/why-its-great-to-have-a-stubborn-child)
  - A recently completed study, which tracked students from their late primary years until well into adulthood, found that kids who frequently break the rules or otherwise defy their parents often go on to become educational over-achievers and high-earning adults. 

- [The Myth of Quality Time](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-the-myth-of-quality-time.html)
  - We delude ourselves when we say otherwise, when we invoke and venerate “quality time,” a shopworn phrase with a debatable promise: that we can plan instances of extraordinary candor, plot episodes of exquisite tenderness, engineer intimacy in an appointed hour. 
  - But people tend not to operate on cue. At least our moods and emotions don’t. We reach out for help at odd points; we bloom at unpredictable ones. The surest way to see the brightest colors, or the darkest ones, is to be watching and waiting and ready for them. 
  - They noted that “a workplace culture that urges new mothers and fathers to hurry back to their cubicles is beginning to shift,” and they cited “more family-friendly policies” at Microsoft and Netflix, which have extended the leave that parents can take. How many parents will step off the fast track and avail themselves of this remains to be seen. But those who do will be deciding that the quantity of time with their brood matters as much as the intensity of it. 

- [What the Mast Brothers Scandal Tells Us About Ourselves](http://www.eater.com/2015/12/23/10657022/what-the-mast-brothers-scandal-tells-us-about-ourselves)
  - most of what's under the hood here is **schadenfreude**
  - their success lies in **packaging** - product seems to perfect marriage betwen thoughful graphics design, object fetishization and artisanal foodstuff
  - We believe that inauthentic things need to be marketed and positioned and sold. Authentic things simply exist and are perfect and in their perfection they handily sell themselves. The notion that if something is authentic, its necessarilty good.
  - their product conveys a sense of **authenticity** with its serene packaging, austere typefaces and solid fraternal affiliations. So when the sstory behind it was revealed, its cover of authenticity was pierced and people now know that they were being sold a story
  - Their only crimes at present are selling their chocolate at ten bucks a bar, and being exemplars of a certain eyeroll-magnet type of hipsterdom, and having beards so iconic 
  - Since the revelations, they have been converted from perveyor of authenticity (laudable) to sellers of branded good( deplorable)
  - This reveals far more about us that it does about them - our desier to buy things because their allure is real and inherent, not because we're being sold on them.

- [Getting More Work Done Without Simply Working More Hours](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/getting-work-done-without-simply-working-hours/)
  - first instinct was to work longer hours – to come in to the office early, stay late, and to give up some of my weekend time. This method of working is hard to sustain without eventually burning out
  - create a routine that coincides with your peak productive hours.
  - “Generally, people are most productive in the morning. The two hours after becoming fully awake are likely to be the best.” 
  - about 50% of a person’s **chronotype** (the propensity for an individual to sleep at a particular time during a 24-hour period) is due to genetics. So if you are morning person, better to stick with a morning routine. If you are a night owl, better do your best work in the night.
  - **nightly to-do list** - plan and establish priorities for the next day.
    - "If you’re waiting until the morning of to organize your day, it’s too late; the day is already crashing down upon you."
  - develope **mental endurance** to handle the boredom on doing routine tasks that seem to take forever.

- [Japanese bookshop stocks only one book at a time](Japanese bookshop stocks only one book at a time)
  - “This bookstore that sells only one book could also be described as ‘a bookstore that organises an exhibition derived from a single book’. For instance, when selling a book on flowers, in the store could be exhibited a flower that actually appears in the book. Also, I ask the authors and editors to be at the bookstore for as much time as possible. This is an attempt to make the two-dimensional book into three-dimensional ambience and experience. I believe that the customers, or readers, should feel as though they are entering ‘inside a book’.” 

- [What It's Like to Be Noam Chomsky's Assistant](http://chronicle.com/article/What-Its-Like-to-Be-Noam/234667)
  - a subtle shift as Noam Chomsky’s mind joined his body from a faraway place, and he arrived in full. 
  - his memory was a force of nature. he has what he calls 'buffers' or little drawers in his brain that he opens to retrieve conversations and correspondence from as long as 50 years ago
  - if Noam Chomsky is distracted and preoccupied, it means he is still walking forward with his usual dogged determination to try to imagine a way out

- [I bought an iPhone because I'm not as sad as I used to be](http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/22/10650830/technology-and-my-depression)
  - active effort to create meaningful distance between myself and the objects I use
  - attention should not be controlled by an object in my pocket
  - suffering from depression
  - left facebook because it was making me sad
  - but the really sad part was feeling inadequate, and never involved enough in the lives of people I cared about. Not seeing their lives play out made it easier to feel comfortable in my sadness. 
  - resigned myself to a social death where there is no urgency to be alive

- [Automate to save mental energy, not time](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/22/automate-to-save-mental-energy-not-time/)
  - Automating things often take longer than doing things manually. But over the long run it saves us more **time** & **mental energy**.
  - Automating is like putting energy into a battery. While you cannot get back all of the energy you put in a battery, you can use some of that energy later when you need it.
  - Write automation scripts when you have time or dont have any interesting thing to do.
  - Suppose it takes you an hour to write a script that only saves you two minutes later. If that two minutes would have derailed your concentration at a critical moment, but it didn’t because you had the script, writing the script may have paid for itself, even though you invested 60 minutes to save 2 minutes. 
  - Automating also makes it easier to hand off scripts to other people.
  - Automation also acts as **informal documentation** of the process.
  - Automation gets rid of **boring, monotonous** tasks so that we can work on more **exciting** stuff

- [Do not remain nameless to yourself](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2015/10/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself.html)
  - Letter by Richard Stallman to one of his colleagues
  - People have erroneour idea about what are worthwhile problems.
  - Take simpler, humbler problems that you can really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasures of success, and of helping a fellow man.
  - Pick a problem you want to solve, not a problem that need solving.  Pick smaller problems that you could partially succeed in solving.  No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.

- [If You’re Too Busy For These 5 Things: Your Life Is More Off-Course Than You Think](https://medium.com/life-learning/if-you-re-too-busy-for-these-5-things-your-life-is-more-off-course-than-you-think-728662a1b09f#.vs07x3jo9)
  - Airplanes arrive on time despite turbulence because pilots are constantly course correcting. Without course correction, catastrophe can result. Our lives are analogous to flights.
  - Small things - if not corrected - become big things, always.
  - **Organizing**
    - Its important to organize our lives. Not carry excessive mental baggage and tension around with us.
    - Most people spend their lives prioritizing urgent and shallow activities. Very few people have organized lives to prioritize almost exclusively important and deep activity
    - Its important to organize our enviroment (messy living space, too much unused stuff etc ). Environment should improve our energy, not drain it.
    - Financial organization is equally important. Unnecessary debt should be avoided, income and expenses should be tracked for healthier financial life
    - Relationships should be meaningful and enjoyable. Toxic, fake relations should be avoided.
    - Health is wealth - proper sleep, less stimulants, good eating habits
    - Spiritual - sense of purpose, power over life/future, clarity about goals, conviction instead of distraction. Eliminate internal conflicts
    - The fastest way to move forward in life is not doing more. It starts with stopping the behaviors holding you back. 
      - Before trying to make more money, stop wasting money.
      - Before getting in shape, stop eating junk food.
  - **Plan and invest in future**
    - “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” — Chinese Proverb 
    - Plan and design your life
    - Decision should be based on 'why ?'
    - Stop planning long term as it slows your potention. Plan short term like 3-6 months. You dont know what doors will open up and you should be open to possibilities. (Tim Ferriss)
  - **Tracking important metrics**
    - When you track things, you can refine them
    - If you’re not tracking the key areas of your life, than you’re probably more off-course than you think. 
    - “When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates. ” — Thomas Monson 
    - Getting organized and investing in your future are futile if you’re not tracking. In regards to the most important areas of your life, you need to be on top of what’s going on. 
    - Research has repeatedly found that when behavior is tracked and evaluated, it improves drastically. 
  - **Prayer and meditation to reduce noise**
    - “I have so much to do today that I’m going to need to spend three hours in prayer in order to be able to get it all done.” — Martin Luther 
    - We get caught in the thick of thin things. Far too late do we realize that in our mad rush, we were pursuing someone else’s goals instead of our own. 
    - Prayer/meditation brings clarity to what we're doing.
  - **Move foward with your goals every day**
    - As Harold Hill has said: “You pile up enough tomorrows, and you’ll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.” 
    - Life is busy. But we need to carve out a little time everyday to progress and improve. Make it a habit.

- [How to hire the best people you've ever worked with](http://pmarchive.com/how_to_hire_the_best_people.html)
  - **Intelligence** is highly overrated. No data to prove correlation between raw intelligence and company success.
  - PhD's are the hardest people to motivate to ship commercially viable products.
  - People with **drive** and **self-motivation**.
    - This comes from some past guilt, desire to make it big or being incredibly TypeA.
    - Drive is independent of education, GPA and socioeconomic background. Its even independent of past career success because driven people dont want to stay long in plances they dont succeed.
    - Drive can be seen in candidate's **background** - what they have done either outside or inside a job.
    - Motivating people who are fundamentally unmotivated is hard. On the other hand, motivating people who are self-motivated is wind at your back. 
    - Look for people for whome this job is a really big chance to succeed, you havent done this kind of job but are determined to succeed regardless.
    - Someone who might come from a challenging background.
    - Be aware of people who worked at successful companies. Someone from IBM might fail as he will think that the whole world works like IBM.
    - A lot of people at successful companies were just there for the ride.
  - **Curiosity** is a proxy for do you love what you do ?
    - Anyone who loves what they do is inherently curious about their job. The immerse themselves in it, stay current in it.
    - Remember, staying current in any field is possible due to the internet.
    - Drive and curiosity coincide pretty frequently.
  - **Ethics** - Priests, rabbis, and ministers should give people a second chance on ethics -- not hiring managers at startups. 
  - **Honesty** - Someone who will say 'I dont know' instead of bullshitting.
  - Behavioral cues
    - Person who never laughs ? Hard to get along with.
    - Person constantly interrupts? Egomaniac
    - Person gives nonlinear answers to simple questions? Complete disorganized and undisciplined on the job. 

- [Toxic relationship habits most people think are normal](http://qz.com/580940/toxic-relationship-habits-most-people-think-are-normal/)
  - Men and women are raised to objectify each other and to objectify their relationship. Thus, our partners are often seen as assets rather than someone to share mutual emotional support
  - There’s been a lot of psychological research into healthy and happy relationships the past few decades and there are some general principles that keep popping up consistently that most people are unaware of or don’t follow. In fact, some of these principles actually go against what is traditionally considered “romantic” or normal in a relationship.
  - **Keeping score** - you keep score of your partners past mistakes and bring it up to make yourself feel righteous or less wrong. You are deflecting current issue itself and ginning up guilt and bitterness from the past to manipulate your partner into feeling wrong in the present. Deal with issues individually unless connected. You something bothers you, speak up right now!
  - **Dropping "hints" and other passive-aggression** - Your partner tries to nudge you to the right direction of figuring out yourself instead of stating the desire or feeling overtly. Instead of openly communicating with one another, you find small and petty ways to piss your partner off so you'll then feel justified in complaining to them.You are insecure in relationshop and feel you'll be judged or criticized for your feelings. Understand that you are not necessarily responsible or obligated to you feelings & desires and given them your full support
  - **Holding the relationship hostage** - You hold the relationship over a complaint or criticism, even blackmail to some extent. As a result, you cannot communicate freely for the fear of distrust and manipulation. Understand that committing to a person and not liking a person isnt the same. Its normal to be angered or annoyed by one's partner at times.
  - **Blaming you partner for your own emotions** - You are feeling crappy and you think your partner is not being sympathetic or supportive enought. You dont realize that they might not be feeling the same emotions. You are being overly selfish. This is a poor maintainance of poor boundaries, developing into codependent tendencies. Take responsibilies for your own emotions and expect your partner to be responsible for theirs.
  - **Jealousy** - Excessive jealousy and controlling behaviors are signs to you own feelings to unworthiness. These feelings should not be forced onto your partner. Being jealous is not a show of affection and nothing to do with not loving your partner enough. Trust your partner.
  - **Buying solutions to relationship problems** - Covering problems with an exciting trip or buying something expensive. The problem always re-emerges and gets even worse next time. Just deal with the problem first, talk about it. Communicate !

  - Dont join a startup just for the money.

- [Peter Theil:Competition Is for Losers](http://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536)
  -  Creating value isn't enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create. You do that by creating a monopoly.
  - Economists use two simplified models to explain the difference: perfect competition and monopoly.
  - "Perfect competition" is considered both the ideal and the default state in Economics 101. So-called perfectly competitive markets achieve equilibrium when producer supply meets consumer demand. Every firm in a competitive market is undifferentiated and sells the same homogeneous products. Since no firm has any market power, they must all sell at whatever price the market determines. If there is money to be made, new firms will enter the market, increase supply, drive prices down and thereby eliminate the profits that attracted them in the first place. If too many firms enter the market, they'll suffer losses, some will fold, and prices will rise back to sustainable levels. Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.
  - The opposite of perfect competition is monopoly. Whereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits.
  - By "monopoly," I mean the kind of company that is so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. Google is a good example of a company that went from 0 to 1: It hasn't competed in search since the early 2000s, when it definitively distanced itself from Microsoft and Yahoo!
  - Capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition, all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: If you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business.
  - Monopolists lie to protect themselves. They know that bragging about their great monopoly invites being audited, scrutinized and attacked. Since they very much want their monopoly profits to continue unmolested, they tend to do whatever they can to conceal their monopoly—usually by exaggerating the power of their (nonexistent) competition. For eg google might call itself as an advertising company rather than a search engine company although it own just 3.4% percent of the global adverts market compared to 68% of the search market
  - In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can't. In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today's margins that it can't possibly plan for a long-term future. Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.
  - Creative monopolies are the best. They invent new and better things. Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world. Creative monopolies aren't just good for the rest of society; they're powerful engines for making it better.
  - That is why one of government's departments works hard to create monopolies (by granting patents to new inventions) even though another part hunts them down (by prosecuting antitrust cases). It is possible to question whether anyone should really be awarded a monopoly simply for having been the first to think of something like a mobile software design. But something like Apple's monopoly profits from designing, producing and marketing the iPhone were clearly the reward for creating greater abundance, not artificial scarcity: Customers were happy to finally have the choice of paying high prices to get a smartphone that actually works. The dynamism of new monopolies itself explains why old monopolies don't strangle innovation. With Apple's iOS at the forefront, the rise of mobile computing has dramatically reduced Microsoft's decadeslong operating system dominance.
  - IBM's hardware monopoly of the 1960s and '70s was overtaken by Microsoft's software monopoly. AT&T had a monopoly on telephone service for most of the 20th century, but now anyone can get a cheap cellphone plan from any number of providers. If the tendency of monopoly businesses was to hold back progress, they would be dangerous, and we'd be right to oppose them. 
  - Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate. Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can't dream of. 
  - Economists are obsessed with competition as an ideal state because its modeled around mathematics where all energy is evenly distributed and everything comes to rest(equilibrium). But equilibrium means statis, and statis means death. 
  - In the real world outside economic theory, every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot. Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.

- [The man who exposed the lie of the war on drugs](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/26/man-who-exposed-lie-war-on-drugs-roberto-saviano-ed-vulliamy)
  - Pablo Escobar was “the first to understand that it’s not the world of cocaine that must orbit around the markets, but the markets that must rotate around cocaine”.
  - The realisation that cocaine capitalism is central to our economic universe made Escobar the Copernicus of organised crime, argues Saviano, adding: “No business in the world is so dynamic, so restlessly innovative, so loyal to the pure free-market spirit as the global cocaine business.” It sounds simple, but it isn’t – it is revolutionary and, says Saviano, it explains the world. 
  - “Capitalism,” says Saviano, “needs the criminal syndicates and criminal markets… This is the most difficult thing to communicate. People – even people observing organised crime – tend to overlook this, insisting upon a separation between the black market and the legal market. It’s the mentality that leads people in Europe and the USA to think of a mafioso who goes to jail as a mobster, a gangster. But he’s not, he’s a businessman, and his business, the black market, has become the biggest market in the world.” 
  - Narco cartels like Guzman’s are not adversaries of global capitalism, nor even pastiches of it; they are integral to – and pioneers of – the free market. They are its role model. 
  - "cartel as corporation, corporation as cartel; cocaine as pure capitalism, capitalism as cocaine"
  - "Cocaine is a safe asset. Cocaine is an anticyclical asset. Cocaine is the asset that fears neither resource shortages nor market inflation"
  - "Cocaine becomes a product like gold or oil,” he adds in conversation, “but more economically potent than gold or oil. With these other commodities, if you don’t have access to mines or wells, it’s hard to break into the market. With cocaine, no. The territory is farmed by desperate peasants, from whose product you can accumulate huge quantities of capital and cash in very little time."
  - "If you’re selling diamonds, you have to get them authenticated, licensed – cocaine, no. Whatever you have, whatever the quality, you can sell it immediately. You are in perfect synthesis with the everyday life and ethos of the global markets – and the ignorance of politicians in the west to understand this is staggering. The European world, the American world, don’t understand these forces, they don’t have the will to understand narco-traffic.”
  - “the force of the mafia is this. If a mafioso messes up, he dies – and thus they develop a system of survival. When they make a mistake, they are killed and replaced by someone even more ruthless, so that the organisation becomes even stronger.”
  - A remarkable passage in Zero Zero Zero explains why: a transcription of an FBI tape recording of a seasoned Italian mafioso in New York schooling young Mexican footsoldiers in the difference between law and “the rules”. Laws are there to be broken, he urges, but the rules of the organisation are sacrosanct, on pain of death. “The law is supposed to be for everybody,” Saviano tells me, “but the rules are made by the so-called men of honour. This is how narco-traffic explains the world, by embracing all the contradictions of the world. To succeed in narco-traffic, you apply the rules to break the law. And today, any big corporation can only succeed if it adopts the same principle – if its rules demand that it break the law.”
